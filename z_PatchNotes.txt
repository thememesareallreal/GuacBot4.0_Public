    - 3 basic reactions: (undertale, ouch, insanity)

      (Literally useless, just a reference for a very select few)

    - Implemented "not now" reaction that turns off Guac reactions for some time

      (allows hotfixes)

      (Progress on restoration of bot)

    - Moved Guac from discord.py to pycord
      (discord.py was discontinued and pycord is currently being worked on)
    
      - Also messed with datetime (only in Music3) because the internet told me to?
        (Something about normal datetime not working anymore and needing timezone to be specified)
    
    - Started restoring Economy cog
      (Made cog and some of the old commands)

      - $balance economy command added

    (To blacklist a whole role at once from reactions.)
